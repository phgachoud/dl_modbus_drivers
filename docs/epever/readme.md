#Epever Tracer 3210a Solar Charge Controller
The current project goal is to generate CSV files with timestamps (UTC) containing extracted data through modbus protocol and an RS485 to USB dongle (about 1USD) connected to a raspberry pi (in my case 3B+)
##Wiring
With the epever solar tracer 3210a the project extracts data through modbus. The blue ethernet cable you can see below is connected to an RS485 to USB device (see below pictures), which is itself on my case connected to an USB port of a raspberry pi (itself of course solar powered ;))
